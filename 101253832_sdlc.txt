and enables faster development with easy maintenance.

The biggest focus in devops is culture. Devops focuses on having a good culture because at the end of the day
people are building your project and people are what matters the most. A person in a good mood
is going to be a lot more productive than somebody in a bad mood. Devops builds a strong team through 
communication, collaboration, transparency and shared responsibilities because when everybody is valued and
involved everyone becomes more interested and builds a better product.
