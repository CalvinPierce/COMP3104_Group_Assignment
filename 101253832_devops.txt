COMP3104 is a devops course at George Brown taught by Pritesh Patel.

The course is teaching us all about the importance of devops while also giving us a hands-on
experience using real devops strategies and services with Amazon Web Services, TravisCI and mpre.

We use services like TravisCI because it automatically tests for us reducing our workload and allowing us 
to focus on actual code, thus being more productive.

We also get good experience using the command line and getting real work experience within github 
creating branches and merges in labs.
